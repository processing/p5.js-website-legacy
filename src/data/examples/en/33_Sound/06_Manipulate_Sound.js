/*
 * @name Playback Rate
 * @arialabel Two grey circles on a light grey background that move as the user moves their mouse and plays different noises based on their distance from each other 
 * @description <p>Load a SoundFile and map its playback rate to
 * mouseY, volume to mouseX. Playback rate is the speed with
 * which the web audio context processings the sound file information.
 * Slower rates not only increase the duration of the sound, but also
 * decrease the pitch because it is being played back at a slower frequency.</p>
 * <p><em><span class="small"> To run this example locally, you will need the
