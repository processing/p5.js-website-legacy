  p2x1: "Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon"

  your-first-sketch1: "In your editor, type the following:"
  your-first-sketch2: "This line of code means \"draw an ellipse, with the center 50 pixels over from the left and 50 pixels down from the top, with a width and height of 80 pixels\"."
  your-first-sketch3: "Save your sketch and refresh your page view in your browser. If you've typed  everything correctly, you'll see this appear in the display window:"
  your-first-sketch4: "If you didn't type it correctly, you might not see anything. If this happens, make sure that you've copied the example code exactly: the numbers should be contained within parentheses and have commas between each of them, and the line should end with a semicolon."
  your-first-sketch5: "One of the most difficult things about getting started with programming is that you have to be very specific about the syntax. The browser isn't always smart enough to know what you mean, and can be quite fussy about the placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with a little practice. Depending on the browser you are using, you can also see errors by looking at the JavaScript \"console\". In Chrome, for example, this is under View > Developer > JavaScript Console."
  your-first-sketch6: "Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more exciting. Delete the text from the last example, and try this:"
  your-first-sketch7: "This program creates a window that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse. When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. We'll explain more about the elements of this program in detail later. For now, run the code, move the mouse, and click to experience it."

  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-10: "Also note that the links to the p5.js library files do not happen from the .eps page with all the tutorial content. Instead they will be located in the html page that is rendering your sketch (in this case, called embed.html)."
