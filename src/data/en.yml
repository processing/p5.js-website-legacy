  p1xh1: Hello!
  p1x1: >-
    p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making
    coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators,
    beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe
    software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
  p1x2: >-
    Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing
    functionality. However, you’re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can
    think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for
    text, input, video, webcam, and sound.
  p2xh2: Community
  p2x1: >-
    We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender
    identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language,
    neuro-type, size, disability, class, religion, culture, subculture,
    political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We
    acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to
    actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all
    kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.

    If you've typed everything correctly, this will appear in the display
    window:
  your-first-sketch9: canvas has a circle of width and height 50 at position 80 x and 80 y
  your-first-sketch10: >-
    If nothing appears, the editor may be having trouble understanding what
    you’ve typed. If this happens, make sure that you've copied the example code
    exactly: the numbers should be contained within parentheses and have commas
    between each of them, the line should end with a semicolon, and ellipse has
    to be spelled correctly.
  your-first-sketch11: >-
    One of the most difficult things about getting started with programming is
    that you have to be very specific about the syntax. The browser isn't always
    smart enough to know what you mean, and can be quite fussy about the
    placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with a little practice. In
    the bottom left of the editor you will find the console section. Here, you
    can find messages from the editor with details about any errors it
    encounters.

    Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more exciting. Modify the
    last example to try this:

    This program creates a canvas that is 400 pixels wide and 400 pixels high,
    and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse. When a
    mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. Run the code,
    move the mouse, and click to experience it.

  writing-a-tutorial-1: >-
    We invite educators, contributors and general enthusiasts to contribute p5js
    tutorials. The p5js project makes creative coding and open source
    development more accessible to a diverse community and we are excited to
    publish tutorials on all aspects of the development process. Our learning
    materials so far include guides on learning p5, programming technique and
    how to contribute to an open source project.

    We welcome new written tutorial contributions and this guide outlines the
    steps of how to propose, prepare and contribute.

    If your topic is not already covered and is not listed as in progress,
    please write a few sentences on what you propose to cover and email us this
    description at education@p5js.org.

  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-1: >-
    When your tutorial is ready for publication, please follow these steps to
    prepare your content for the p5js website.
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-2: 'Prepare the content of your tutorial as a tutorial-name.hbs file with '
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-3: this basic structure
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-4: '. As is shown in this file, it must contain a header as shown below:'
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-5: >-
    The folder containing your tutorial will be placed in the 'tutorials' folder
    of the p5js site. The file called index.hbs is the 
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-6: 'p5.js tutorials landing page,'
  writing-a-tutorial-how-prepare-7: ' and the test-tutorial.hbs file is the test tutorial.'

  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-title: Embedding p5.js sketches
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-1: >-
    Using p5js means you can illustrate your tutorial with animated, interactive
    or editable code examples to demonstrate programming concepts. Your examples
    should be prepared as p5.js sketches and can be embedded into the tutorial
    in two ways.
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-2: 'If the example is to be editable like in '
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-3: the reference pages
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-4: ' of the p5js site, the p5 sketch should be embedded into the html page using the p5js widget. Follow '
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-5: 'this guide '
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-6: 'on how to embed p5js sketches using the widget written by '
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-7: . You can also explore this in action on the
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-8: ' test tutorial page'
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-9: .
  writing-a-tutorial-embedding-10: >-
    If the example is to be animated and/or interactive but not editable. The
    p5.js sketch should be embedded into the page as an iframe as described
    below.
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-title: Embed a p5 sketch using an iframe
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-1: >-
    An iframe is like creating a window through which you can explore another
    page, sandboxed from the rest of your page. In this case it will be a window
    to the index.html containing your p5.js sketch. 
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-2: >-
    Put your p5 sketches in the /src/assets/learn folder of the site, in a
    folder labelled with the name of your sketch as shown in the screenshot.
    This is where all the images and p5 sketches linked by iframe should be
    stored.
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-3: >-
    In the subfolders containing your p5 examples there should be a sketch.js
    file and the embed.html file for the sketch. 
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-4: >-
    Make sure your embed.html file has the correct paths to the p5 libraries of
    the site. If your file structure is the same as above, the path to the p5.js
    library should be "../../../js/p5.min.js".
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-5: >-
    You can then embed the p5js index files as iframes in the .hbs file that
    contains your tutorial content. The embed code for the iframe would then
    be: 
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-6: >-
    Styling for the iframe (this could directly into the post or in a
    stylesheet):  
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-7: 'Here you can find the naked sketch running: '
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-8: 'And here it is embedded in the p5 site using the code below:  '
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-9: >-
    One thing to note is that you need to manually set the size of the iframe,
    so it works best if things are a standard size.
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-10: >-
    Also note that the links to the p5.js library files do not happen from the
    .eps page with all the tutorial content. Instead they will be located in the
    html page that is rendering your sketch (in this case, called embed.html).
  writing-a-tutorial-iframe-11: 'More information on embedding p5.js sketches can be found '
  writing-a-tutorial-embed-iframe-12: here.
  writing-a-tutorial-finishing-title: Finishing up
  writing-a-tutorial-finishing-1: >-
    Once your have finished writing your tutorial and your content has been
    given the thumbs up. Fork the p5.js website repository, prepare your content
    as described above and then issue a pull request to the p5.js website
    repository so we can publish your contribution!

    In the digital world, when we want to talk about a color, precision is
    required. Saying "Hey, can you make that circle bluish-green?" will not do.
    Color, rather, is defined as a range of numbers. Let's start with the
    simplest case: black & white or grayscale. 0 means black, 255 means white.
    In between, every other number—50, 87, 162, 209, and so on—is a shade of
    gray ranging from black to white.
  color-p2x1: 'By adding the '
  color-p2x2: ' and '
  color-p2x3: ' functions before something is drawn, we can set the color of any given shape. There is also the function '
  color-p2x4: ', which sets a background color for the window. Here''s an example.'

    background(255);    // Setting the background to white 
     stroke(0);          // Setting the outline (stroke) to black 
     fill(150);          // Setting the interior of a shape (fill) to grey 
     rect(50,50,75,100); // Drawing the rectangle
  color-p3x1: 'Stroke or fill can be eliminated with the functions: '
  color-p3x2: ' and '
  color-p3x3: >-
    . Our instinct might be to say "stroke(0)" for no outline, however, it is
    important to remember that 0 is not "nothing", but rather denotes the color
    black. Also, remember not to eliminate both—with 
  color-p3x4: ' and '
  color-p3x5: ', nothing will appear!'
  color-p4x1: >-
    In addition, if we draw two shapes, p5.js will always use the most recently
    specified stroke and fill, reading the code from top to bottom.
  color-rgb-title: RGB Color
  color-rgb-p1x1: >-
    Remember finger painting? By mixing three "primary" colors, any color could
    be generated. Swirling all colors together resulted in a muddy brown. The
    more paint you added, the darker it got. Digital colors are also constructed
    by mixing three primary colors, but it works differently from paint. First,
    the primaries are different: red, green, and blue (i.e., "RGB" color). And
    with color on the screen, you are mixing light, not paint, so the mixing
    rules are different as well.
  color-rgb-li1: Red + Green = Yellow
  color-rgb-li2: Red + Blue = Purple
  color-rgb-li3: Green + Blue = Cyan (blue-green)
  color-rgb-li4: Red + Green + Blue = White
  color-rgb-li5: No colors = Black
  color-rgb-p2x1: >-
    This assumes that the colors are all as bright as possible, but of course,
    you have a range of color available, so some red plus some green plus some
    blue equals gray, and a bit of red plus a bit of blue equals dark purple.
    While this may take some getting used to, the more you program and
    experiment with RGB color, the more it will become instinctive, much like
    swirling colors with your fingers. And of course you can't say "Mix some red
    with a bit of blue," you have to provide an exact amount. As with grayscale,
    the individual color elements are expressed as ranges from 0 (none of that
    color) to 255 (as much as possible), and they are listed in the order R, G,
    and B. You will get the hang of RGB color mixing through experimentation,
    but next we will cover some code using some common colors.
  color-transparency-title: Color Transparency
  color-transparency-p1x1: >-
    In addition to the red, green, and blue components of each color, there is
    an additional optional fourth component, referred to as the color's "alpha".
    Alpha means transparency and is particularly useful when you want to draw
    elements that appear partially see-through on top of one another. The alpha
    values for an image are sometimes referred to collectively as the "alpha
    channel" of an image.
  color-transparency-p2x1: >-
    It is important to realize that pixels are not literally transparent, this
    is simply a convenient illusion that is accomplished by blending colors.
    Behind the scenes, p5.js takes the color numbers and adds a percentage of
    one to a percentage of another, creating the optical perception of blending.
    (If you are interested in programming "rose-colored" glasses, this is where
    you would begin.)
  color-transparency-p3x1: >-
    Alpha values also range from 0 to 255, with 0 being completely transparent
    (i.e., 0% opaque) and 255 completely opaque (i.e., 100% opaque).
  color-custom-ranges-title: Custom Color Ranges
  color-custom-ranges-p1x1: >-
    RGB color with ranges of 0 to 255 is not the only way you can handle color
    in p5.js, in fact, it allows us to think about color any way we like. For
    example, you might prefer to think of color as ranging from 0 to 100 (like a
    percentage). You can do this by specifying a custom 
  color-custom-ranges-p2x1: >-
    The above function says: "OK, we want to think about color in terms of red,
    green, and blue. The range of RGB values will be from 0 to 100."
  color-custom-ranges-p3x1: >-
    Although it is rarely convenient to do so, you can also have different
    ranges for each color component:
  color-custom-ranges-p4x1: >-
    Now we are saying "Red values go from 0 to 100, green from 0 to 500, blue
    from 0 to 10, and alpha from 0 to 255."
  color-custom-ranges-p5x1: >-
    Finally, while you will likely only need RGB color for all of your
    programming needs, you can also specify colors in the HSB (hue, saturation,
    and brightness) mode. Without getting into too much detail, HSB color works
    as follows:
  color-custom-ranges-li1x1: Hue
  color-custom-ranges-li1x2: '—The color type, ranges from 0 to 360 by default.'
  color-custom-ranges-li2x1: Saturation
  color-custom-ranges-li2x2: '—The vibrancy of the color, 0 to 100 by default.'
  color-custom-ranges-li3x1: Brightness
  color-custom-ranges-li3x2: '—The, well, brightness of the color, 0 to 100 by default.'
  color-custom-ranges-p6x1: 'With '
  color-custom-ranges-p6x2: ' you can set your own ranges for these values. Some prefer a range of 0-360 for hue (think of 360 degrees on a color wheel) and 0-100 for saturation and brightness (think of 0-100%).'

  coordinate-system-description-title: Coordinate System and Shapes
  coordinate-system-description-p1x1: >-
    Before we begin programming with p5, we must first channel our eighth grade
    selves, pull out a piece of graph paper, and draw a line. The shortest
    distance between two points is a good old fashioned line, and this is where
    we begin, with two points on that graph paper.
  coordinate-system-description-p2x1: >-
    The above figure shows a line between point A (1,0) and point B (4,5). If
    you wanted to direct a friend of yours to draw that same line, you would
    give them a shout and say "draw a line from the point one-zero to the point
    four-five, please." Well, for the moment, imagine your friend was a computer
    and you wanted to instruct this digital pal to display that same line on its
    screen. The same command applies (only this time you can skip the
    pleasantries and you will be required to employ a precise formatting). Here,
    the instruction will look like this:
  coordinate-system-description-p3x1: >-
    Even without having studied the syntax of writing code, the above statement
    should make a fair amount of sense. We are providing a command (which we
    will refer to as a "function") for the machine to follow entitled "line." In
    addition, we are specifying some arguments for how that line should be
    drawn, from point A (1,0) to point B (4,5). If you think of that line of
    code as a sentence, the function is a verb and the arguments are the objects
    of the sentence. The code sentence also ends with a semicolon instead of a
    period.
  coordinate-system-description-p4x1: >-
    The key here is to realize that the computer screen is nothing more than a
    fancier piece of graph paper. Each pixel of the screen is a coordinate - two
    numbers, an "x" (horizontal) and a "y" (vertical) - that determines the
    location of a point in space. And it is our job to specify what shapes and
    colors should appear at these pixel coordinates.
  coordinate-system-description-p5x1: >-
    Nevertheless, there is a catch here. The graph paper from eighth grade
    ("Cartesian coordinate system") placed (0,0) in the center with the y-axis
    pointing up and the x-axis pointing to the right (in the positive direction,
    negative down and to the left). The coordinate system for pixels in a
    computer window, however, is reversed along the y-axis. (0,0) can be found
    at the top left with the positive direction to the right horizontally and
    down vertically.
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-title: Simple Shapes
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p1x1: >-
    The vast majority of p5 programming examples are visual in nature. These
    examples, at their core, involve drawing shapes and setting pixels. Let's
    begin by looking at four primitive shapes.
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p2x1: >-
    For each shape, we will ask ourselves what information is required to
    specify the location and size (and later color) of that shape and learn how
    p5 expects to receive that information. In each of the diagrams below, we'll
    assume a window with a width of 100 pixels and height of 100 pixels.
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p3x1: 'A '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p3x2: ' is the easiest of the shapes and a good place to start. To draw a point, we only need an x and y coordinate.'
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p4x1: 'A '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p4x2: ' isn''t terribly difficult either and simply requires two points: (x1,y1) and (x2,y2):'
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p5x1: 'Once we arrive at drawing a '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p5x2: >-
    , things become a bit more complicated. In p5, a rectangle is specified by
    the coordinate for the top left corner of the rectangle, as well as its
    width and height.
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p6x1: >-
    A second way to draw a rectangle involves specifying the centerpoint, along
    with width and height. If we prefer this method, we first indicate that we
    want to use the 
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p6x2: ' mode before the instruction for the rectangle itself. Note that p5 is case-sensitive.'
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p7x1: >-
    Finally, we can also draw a rectangle with two points (the top left corner
    and the bottom right corner). The mode here is 
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p7x2: . Note this example gives the same result on screen as the example above.
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x1: 'Once we have become comfortable with the concept of drawing a rectangle, an '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x2: ' is a snap. In fact, it is identical to '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x3: ' with the difference being that an ellipse is drawn where the bounding box of the rectangle would be. The default mode for '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x4: ' is '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x5: ', rather than '
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p8x6: .
  coordinate-system-simple-shapes-p9x1: >-
    Now let's look at what some code with shapes in more complete form, with
    canvas dimensions of 200 by 200. Note the use of the createCanvas() function
    to specify the width and height of the canvas.

  project-q-1-1: What are you up to?
  project-q-1-2: How did you get started with p5.js?
  project-a-1-1-roni-cantor: >-
    I just graduated from Ryerson University's New Media program. Coming from 4
    years of coding and making robots, I decided to take a break and play with
    some more traditional forms of art—while still coding and playing with
    robots.
  project-a-1-2-roni-cantor: 'I first started using p5.js at '
  project-a-1-3-roni-cantor: '! After using '

  project-q-2: How did you use p5.js in this project?
  project-a-2-1-roni-cantor: >-
    I used p5.js in this project to generate the sine wave and lerp (linear
    interpolation) formulas and display the visuals in the
  project-a-2-2-roni-cantor: >-
    . I then used a feature in my code that exported my programmed graphic into
    an
  project-a-2-3-roni-cantor: ' file. I needed an SVG file to give to the plotter—an '
  project-a-2-4-roni-cantor: >-
    —so that it understood where to draw the lines that I programmed. I sent
    this information to the plotter with a program called
  project-a-2-5-roni-cantor: '!'
  project-q-3: What's your favorite p5.js feature?
  project-a-3-roni-cantor: ' because lines are fun and "lerp" is a fun word to say!'
  project-q-4: >-
    Did you face any challenges working on this project? If so, how did you
    overcome them?
  project-a-4-roni-cantor: >-
    It was my first time using p5.js, Inkscape, and a plotter! I really
    benefited from the people around me who had used p5 before, as well as
    online guides and forums.

  project-a-1-1-qianqian: I am a Chinese artist and designer based in Los Angeles.
  project-a-1-2-qianqian: >-
    My partner introduced me to p5.js, which I learned mainly by watching free
    online video tutorials. My first p5.js project was drawing some shapes with
    different colors.
  project-a-2-1-qianqian: >-
    This project started with an idea of teaching my mom, who lives in China and
    doesn’t speak English, to code with p5.js. This project was difficult on
    multiple levels, and I wanted to start by identifying the main reasons why
    it’s more challenging for someone like my mother to learn to code—primarily
    due to the lack of free creative coding education resources. Most of the
    free resources to learn creative coding are unavailable in China. The p5.js
    tutorials on YouTube as well as the p5.js Twitter and Instagram accounts are
    inaccessible in China because of internet censorship.
  project-a-2-2-qianqian: 'I learned a lot from YouTube videos such as the '
  project-a-2-3-qianqian: >-
    , but the more I watched coding tutorials online, the more I realized how
    difficult it is to find other womxn and people of color teaching coding,
    especially in Mandarin. I wanted to help other Chinese womxn relate to
    creative coding.
  project-a-2-4-qianqian: >-
    I am working on opening up the video channels to other Chinese creatives who
    want to contribute to the educational resource together, like interviews and
    guest tutorials. If you are interested in teaching/talking about creative
    coding in Mandarin, HMU!
  project-a-3-1-qianqian: 'The '
  project-a-3-2-qianqian: ' is my favorite feature. It makes web-based creative coding seamless.'
  project-a-4-1-qianqian: >-
    Learning to code in a second language was difficult and the lack of
    community made this process even harder. I hope to speak from my experience
    as a beginner and someone who once felt like an outsider to the creative
    coding and video tutorial world.
  project-a-4-2-qianqian: >-
    I spend a lot of time researching the latest technology for my videos. In
    the end, I decided on using my phone to record and iMovie to edit. I hope to
    encourage others that it doesn’t take a lot of expensive gears to get
    started making instructional videos.
  project-a-4-3-qianqian: >-
    Another issue I came across was my own fear of putting myself online. I
    first had to get over my anxiety of making mistakes in the videos or
    receiving negative comments online. Often womxn and people of color are
    targets for online harassment. I’m hoping to help set an example for other
    womxn and people of color that it’s ok to put yourselves online and
    strengthen your communities by sharing your knowledge. Eventually, we will
    be able to stop online harassment by creating strong diverse communities.

    negative, which makes it look like Airi is falling down.

    This summer, I gave myself a challenge of making typographic posters with

    quickly in the present mode. For this project in particular, I had to do a

    committing to GitHub.
  project-a-4-1-chung: 'I had some troubles with handling font, alpha channel and z-depth in '
  project-a-4-2-chung: ' mode. I am still not happy with all my decisions. But in general, it was helpful to search the forum and not to forget to break down problems into smaller ones and iterate little by little. Also, I had issues with rendering out video files directly out of p5.js. Screen recording was not an option because of intermittent frame rate drops (my laptop is pretty slow).

    I had been dabbling in
  project-a-1-4-casey-louise: ' since 2012. I was introduced to Processing by my friend Pedro while I was studying graphic design, and it blew my mind.

  project-a-1-5-casey-louise: >-

    playful. I’m a C# programmer, so this was a good segway into JavaScript for
    me.
  project-a-2-1-casey-louise: >-
    Casey: I was putting off learning shaders for a long time, and I was also
    curious if I could use them in p5.js. Then I heard about a grant for open
    source, storytelling, and learning resource projects at ITP called
  project-a-2-2-casey-louise: >-
    . Since I wasn't finding much in the way of p5.js + shader documentation, I
    decided to figure out how they're implemented in p5.js and create a resource
    for others to learn. When I told Louise about the project, she was
    immediately excited about learning and teaching shaders in p5.js. She's been
    great about making sure the project is a learning resource and not just a
    collection of examples.

    of p5.js and how code works in general. I had to repeat the p5.js basics a
    couple of times, and then I drew a chart to memorize and to teach the way I
    understood the p5.js structure and code with strong constraints I set up. It
    was an excellent teaching and learning experience.
