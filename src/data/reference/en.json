It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.<br /><br /> The main difference to the <b>random()</b> function is that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed only for the lifespan of the program; see the <a href=\"#/p5/noiseSeed\">noiseSeed()</a> function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise, depending on the number of coordinates given. The resulting value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be animated by moving through the noise space as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd dimension can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added together for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such, only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when using <b>noise()</b> within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most applications, but this will differ depending on use."

By default, noise is computed over 4 octaves with each octave contributing  exactly half than its predecessor, starting at 50% strength for the 1st  octave. This falloff amount can be changed by adding an additional function  parameter. Eg. a falloff factor of 0.75 means each octave will now have  75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave.

        "Utility function for formatting numbers into strings. Similar to <a href=\"#/p5/nf\">nf()</a> but puts an additional \"_\" (space) in front of positive numbers just in case to align it with negative numbers which includes \"-\" (minus) sign. The main usecase of nfs() can be seen when one wants to align the digits (place values) of a non-negative number with some negative number (See the example to get a clear picture). There are two versions: one for formatting float, and one for formatting int. The values for the digits, left, and right parameters should always be positive integers. (IMP): The result on the canvas basically the expected alignment can vary based on the typeface you are using. (NOTE): Be cautious when using left and right parameters as it prepends numbers of 0's if the parameter if greater than the current length of the number. For example if number is 123.2 and left parameter passed is 4 which is greater than length of 123 (integer part) i.e 3 than result will be 0123.2. Same case for right parameter i.e. if right is 3 than the result will be 123.200."
